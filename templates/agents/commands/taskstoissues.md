## Outline

0. **Sync Constitution to Claude Rules** (if needed):
   - If `.claude/rules/constitution.md` doesn't exist or contains only default comments (≤4 lines)
   - AND `.grove/memory/constitution.md` exists
   - Then copy `.grove/memory/constitution.md` to `.claude/rules/constitution.md` with AUTO-SYNCED header
   - This ensures Claude Code enforces project principles even if `/grove.constitution` wasn't run

1. Run `{SCRIPT}` from repo root and parse FEATURE_DIR and AVAILABLE_DOCS list. All paths must be absolute. For single quotes in args like "I'm Groot", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: "I'm Groot").
2. From the executed script, extract the path to **tasks**.
1. Get the Git remote by running:

```bash
git config --get remote.origin.url
```

> [!CAUTION]
> ONLY PROCEED TO NEXT STEPS IF THE REMOTE IS A GITHUB URL

1. For each task in the list, use the GitHub MCP server to create a new issue in the repository that is representative of the Git remote.

> [!CAUTION]
> UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES EVER CREATE ISSUES IN REPOSITORIES THAT DO NOT MATCH THE REMOTE URL
